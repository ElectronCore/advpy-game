Simple text-based branching adventure game
using the console, maybe some ASCII, perhaps try a Qt integration at some point.
Spawn in a mysterious text-based world with severe amnesia, guided by branching dialogue boxes. 
rudimentary turn-based combat, inventory and status static meters/boxes
gotta refresh the console every frame
i'd love to be able to write the text onscreen letter by letter instead of a giant refresh
turns out that YOU were the one who killed the princess after all! AUDIBLE GASP!!!
